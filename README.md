# VFDTest
Control Siemens Micromaster 3 through USS Protocol over RS485
working so far with variable frequency and positioning.
TODO for more reliable communication:
add a 5v level adjuster and power the RS485 board with 5v as the 3.3 levels are a bit sketchy
other than that it wokrs as it should at 9600 and 19200 Baud
I did not find the specs of the 7 words answer message yet thus error handling is none existing
